## Pedagogy 
[Inspired by the carpentries](https://orchid00.github.io/The_Carpentries_info/overview-of-carpentries-pedagogic-model.html)

- Active learning (practice) is key, this course will have minimal components where I speak to you
i.e. lecture. Instead, we will utilise 'live coding'.
  - Live coding will show you my workflow, my mistakes (everyone makes them) and how I troubleshoot them!
  - When you run into difficulty utilise the chat in class, communicating with others is key to understanding
  - Spaced retrieval
  - Managed cognitive load
  
##  Assessments
These will be made available as we get closer to the time, more information on moodle.
