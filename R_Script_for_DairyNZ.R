# Functional form ----
## In r text by itself means an object, i.e.
penguins
## text with paranthesis means a function, i.e.
sum()
## text with two colons means a function within a specific package, i.e.
palmerpenguins::penguins

# Viewing data ---- 
penguins
glimpse(penguins)
view(penguins)

# Documentation ----
## You can type a question mark followed by a function/object to view any help/
##    documentation if there is any
?penguins

# Plotting ----
## Assigning data to the plot
ggplot(data = penguins)
## Mapping variables to aesthetics
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))
## Adding a geometrical object to represent the data

## Note the error code in the previous plot, this comes from missing values in the data.
# We can view them with:
penguins %>% 
  select(species, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g) %>% 
  filter(is.na(body_mass_g) | is.na(flipper_length_mm))
# Don't worry, the code doesn't make sense to you now, it will soon!

# Adding colours for species
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, colour = species)) + 
  geom_point()
# Adding a smooth line
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, colour = species)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
# Keeping one smooth line for the population, but colour by species
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = species)) +
  geom_smooth()
# Making line straight
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +

# Adding shapes

# Adding plot labels
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +

# Exercises 2.2.5 ----
## How many rows & columns in penguins?
glimpse(penguins) #344 x 8
penguins #344 x 8
view(penguins) #344 x 8

## What does 'bill_depth_mm' mean in penguins?
?penguins
# a number denoting bill depth (millimeters)

## Make a scatterplot of bill depth and length. Describe relationship.
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point()
## Lame plot, could make better by looking at species differences
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = species)) 
## and, could add a smooth line for more insight
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = species)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(colour = species))
# this can be simplified by moving the colour mapping to global aesthetic settings
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, colour = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

## What's wrong with this code
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_point()
## No mappings, error message tells you that you need to add x and y aesthetics.
