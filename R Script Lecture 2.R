# Continuing chapter 2 ----

# So far we have written code like this

  geom_point()

# But we can shorten it by following standard conventions

# |> is called the pipe, it takes things to the right of it and then passes it
# to the right. It can be interpreted as 'and then'. There are two pipe operators:
# ' |> ' and ' %>% ' that you may see in the wild.

# Moving to mapping categorical variables
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar()

# Reordering bars 
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = fct_infreq(species))) +

## Binwidth is important, sets the size of the groups (width of the bars on histogram)

# Exploring binwidth 
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +

# Exercise 2.4.3 q 1:
# Make a bar plot of species of penguins, where you assign species to the y aesthetic. How is this plot different?

# Boxplots to view distributions

# Three+ variables

# Chapter 3 ----
# Coding basics

# You can use R as a calculator
1*100
2/4
(2*3)/2
5^2
sin(pi/2)

# You can create named objects 
test_name <- 5
# and call named objects
test_name

# You can create objects with multiple values i.e. a vector
primes <- c(2, 3, 5, 7)

# You can do operations to objects
primes^2

# You can created new objects refering to old objects
primes2 <- primes^2

# Naming conventions
# Names cannot start with a number, but can contain numbers. They should also be descriptive
#1name <- 5
# doesnt work
name1 <- 5 
# does work

# Naming styles
this_is_snake_case <- 5
# Ben prefers snake case
this.is.period.case <- 5
thisIsCamelCase <- 5
this_follows.No.conventionAndIs_hard.to_read <- 5

# Function form
# function(argument1 = variable1, ..., argumentn = variablen)
# for example
seq(from = 1, to = 10)

# you can assign text to an object
